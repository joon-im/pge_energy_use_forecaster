# PG&E Home Energy Forecaster

This dashboard is built in R using the Shiny web application framework. It utilizes data downloaded from my personal account through the Pacific Gas and Electric Company website. It takes an iterative forecasting approach using tools from the [modeltime](https://github.com/business-science/modeltime) forecasting suite to predict my home's energy usage and costs based on both daily and monthly data.
